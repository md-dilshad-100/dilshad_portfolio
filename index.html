            <h3>Project Title</h3>
            <img src="Screenshot (36).png" alt="Project Image">
            <p>Developed a comprehensive online hotel booking website, integrating front-end, back-end, and database com    ponents to deliver a seamless user experience. The front-end was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, featuring
                a responsive design and intuitive interface for browsing and booking hotels. The back-end, powered by Node.js
                and Express, handled user authentication, booking management, and API interactions. Utilized MongoDB for a
                robust database solution to manage hotel listings, reservations, and user data efficiently. This full-stack project
                demonstrates my capability to create a cohesive and functional web application that effectively bridges
                user interactions with server-side operations and data management.
